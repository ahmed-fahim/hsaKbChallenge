The task is to create a system that controls the usage of APIs globally and also per user.

Available functions of the system.
	1. Create API_NAME API_URI
		Creates an api with the name of API_Name and the accessable uri = API_URI
		Create getData dataURI.com -> creation of an api getData that accesses URI ataURI.com
	   
	2. Limit API_NAME LIMIT_AMOUNT
		Assignes Limit upon a certain api API_NAME.
		Limit getData 5 -> means the api "getData" cannot be accessed 
		more than 5 times in a minute in the overall system
		
	3. LimitUsr USER_NAME API_NAME LIMIT_AMOUNT
		Assignes Limit upon a certain api API_NAME for a certain USER_NAME.
		Limit Fahim getData 5 -> means the api "getData" cannot be accessed 
		more than 5 times in a minute by user Fahim.
		
		N.B: if User Limit is not crossed, but global Limit is crossed, 
		than also access would be restricted		
		
	4. Call USER_NAME API_URI
		User USER_NAME attempts to call API_URI
		
	5. ShowMaxHit API_URI
		Supposed to show a message in below format:
		API Name = API_NAME, Uri = API_URI, MaxHit = maxNumberOfHitByAnyUser, User = NameOfUserWithMaxHit
		
		
/* How to Use */
1. Run the application.
2. Write any of the above APIs with proper argument passing.
3. The results would be shown in the console.
